		<h2>Ignite CfA!</h2>

		<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> 8&ndash;10pm, Wednesday, September 24<br />
		<strong>WHERE:</strong> Mezzanine, 444 Jessie St.<br />
		<strong>WHAT:</strong> Snacks, drinks and fun at Ignite CfA!</p>
		<p>A favorite annual Summit tradition. An Ignite is a story that's exactly 5 minutes long, told by a speaker who's working with 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds (ready or not). It's fun, it's fast, and the format forces you to really think about what you want to say.</p>
		<p>Talks can be geeky, fanciful, poignant, educational, and/or funny. Maximum fun, minimum time. It's gonna be a blast.</p>
		<p><em>The submission deadline has passed. Accepted speakers will be notified by Friday, September 19, 3pm PDT.</em></p>
