		<strong>WHERE:</strong> Mezzanine, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mezzanine/@37.782502,-122.408093,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x8085808431618bbf:0x35448f8132567511" target="_blank">444 Jessie St.</a><br />
		<strong>WHAT:</strong> Snacks, drinks and fun at Ignite CfA!</p>
		<p>A favorite #CfASummit tradition, an Ignite is a story that's exactly 5 minutes long, told by a speaker who's working with 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds (ready or not). It's fun, it's fast, and the format forces you to really think about what you want to say.</p>
		<p>Talks can be geeky, fanciful, poignant, educational, and/or funny. Maximum fun, minimum time. It's gonna be a blast.</p>
		<p><em>The submission deadline has passed. Accepted speakers will be notified by Friday, September 19, 3 p.m. PDT.</em></p>
